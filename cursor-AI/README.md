# AI coding assistent using cursor AI IDE

This readme doc represent my experience with cursor AI IDE
as a coding assistent.

As most people know that cursor is not just an ordinary code editor
but it's an IDE that comes bundled with build-in AI assistent.
It has a chat mode, where we can interact with cursor directly to
perform tasks like generating code, suggesting possible alternative
of solution, generating code flow to understand the existing codebase.

I found that when asking for code generation for some issue, sometimes
cursor generates code on it's own ie. generate a whole new module for
possible solution, instead of using existing structure followed in the
codebase.

But overall I am quite satisfied with cursor IDE as we can ask for
possible alternative solutions for the given problem, generate commit
message with existing changes with technical details in understandable
language, generating code flow for existing codebase etc.

I have mostly used the cursor AI IDE till now to generate commit messages
as well as generating code in some of the issues I was working on.

I understand that we need to be very careful while using code generated
by cursor IDE in our codebase, but overall it's quite helpful in certain
situations.
